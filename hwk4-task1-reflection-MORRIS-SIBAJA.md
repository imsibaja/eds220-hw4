# Task 1: The politics of pixels reading

When working with satellite data, it’s easy to assume that it is inherently objective and equally accessible to everyone. However, Bennett et al., in their paper The Politics of Pixels: A Review and Agenda for Critical Remote Sensing (2022 [1]), challenge this assumption, arguing that remote sensing needs a critical lens. They emphasize that various sociopolitical factors influence who collects remotely sensed data, how it’s collected, and ultimately, who benefits from its insights. This reading will encourage you to explore the biases and inequalities that can be embedded in remote sensing technologies and practices.

**Reflecting on your personal or professional background, how might sociopolitical factors shape the availability and interpretation of satellite and other remotely sensed data for communities or organizations you’re familiar with?**

Growing up as a family owned citrus rancher, I recognize how sociopolitical factors influence access to remote sensing data, which is vital for monitoring, say, crop health. Corporate farming usually are the only one who benefit from subsidized or proprietary satellite tools, while smaller farmers like ours may lack access to this kind of recurring high-resolution imagery. This leads to those bigger companies being favored over family businesses such as ours, as their technology leads to higher yield crops. Helping smaller farmers with their accessibility to remote sensing may be essential to addressing these disparities within the working class of farmers.
